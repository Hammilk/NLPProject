# NLPProject

Check dependencies in environment.yaml
All 3 models in project Folder.
transformer.py uses GPU acceleration with CUDA version 12.4
Corpus in train.csv

countVector.py = basic word frequency
transformers.py = use distilbert to create embeddings
approxNearestNeighbor = an approximate k nearest neighbor


To run. Import yaml file to virtual environment. Change relative references for the file name in the model. In command line: python3 {modelname.py}.


TODO:
Maybe implement TFIDF? Hard maybe
    Perhaps in an emsemble method?

Finish write up
